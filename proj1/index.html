<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
  <h4 align="middle">Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</h4>
  <p>In this part, we rasterized the triangles by utilizing the line test we went over in lecture. 
    More specifically, our algorithm goes line by line, uses the line test to see if that sample lies 
    within the triangle or not, and stops checking that line once it sees a sample that’s no longer in the triangle. 
    Then it moves onto the next line, and so on until all the lines that make up the triangle have been checked.</p>
  <h4 align="middle">Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</h4>
  <p>Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks every sample in the triangle’s bounding box because it won’t ever check every single pixel in the bounding box. 
    I think this is easier to demonstrate with a picture: see below.</p>
    
    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="images/Untitled-1.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">This algorithm performs the same as the “check all samples” algorithm if the triangle is a 90-degree triangle with its 90-degree corner situated right at the upper right corner. 
             In which case all samples will be checked, since we’re sweeping from left to right. 
             But it performs no worse because it won’t ever check samples twice.</figcaption>

    <p>I don’t understand what part of this scene of colored triangles would qualify as “interesting”, so I took two screenshots just in case our tastes differ.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Create an updated version of svg/transforms/robot.svg with cubeman doing something more interesting, 
  like waving or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity.

  Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words.</h4>

          <img src="images/ryu.png" align="middle" width="117px"/>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  
  <p>I used Illustrator to pose the robot to my fancy, then copy/pasted those new values for the transforms of each of the shapes into the original robot svg file. 
    I know one could go into the SVG file and hand-alter the values one-by-one as well, but that's not as fun. 
    (Cubeman's red is also based on the color of Ryu's headband: it's slightly different from the default.)</p>


<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</h4>

	<p>For my implementation of supersampling, I decided to increase my sample buffer in set_sample_rate, artificially increasing my resolution. Then, in my rasterize_triangle I multiiplied every x and y by the square root of the sample rate and set up my box by picking the min and max x and y from these altered points and looping through my box as normal. (One key change I did was change the fill_pixel function to have y also be multiplied by the square root of sample rate since there are now more x’s in a row.)

	The next thing I did was average the color values in resolve_to_framebuffer. Inside of the already existing double for loop, I put another nested double for loop with sx and sy for sample x and sample y which limits itself to being less than the square root of sample rate. I then go into the sample buffer, manually multiplying y by the square root of the sample rate, then adding sy, and following the rest of what we do in fill_pixel except for adding sx to the end and multiplying x by square root of sample rate. Finally I divided the end color pulled by sample rate to get the color I would use in frame_buffer. </p>

<h4 align="middle">Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner.</h4>
	
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part2-1.png" align="middle" width="800px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Default viewing parameters.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part2-2.png" align="middle" width="800px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Sample rate = 4.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part2-3.png" align="middle" width="800px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Sample rate = 16.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h4 align="middle">Explain why these results are observed.</h4>

<p>We see these results (the triangles becoming "smoother") because increasing the sample rate means that we have more pieces of data to use in assembling our representation of our original image. When our sample rate is 1, that means that for each pixel, we're only taking in the data at one part of the original image, and using that data to dictate the color of the pixel. This effectively works as a binary of sorts, telling us if the pixel we're looking at is, for example, red or white in the case of the red triangle pictured in the first image. 

However, if we increase our sample rate, we don't need to limit ourselves to just being red or white: instead, we can look at the average of all our values sampled (or supersampled if you will) to create the illusion of a smoother edge. Anti-aliasing effectively places semi-transparent, or "blended" pixels, along the border of an otherwise sharp edge to fool the eye into filling in the blanks more naturally. </p>
